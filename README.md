### WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO
I decided to create a vanilla React App with no other frameworks. I created my logo and favicons using Adobe XD. I used Netlify to host my website and it also come with some nice features. Netlify is connected directly to my Github repository so after I push any changes, Netlify will automatically create a production build with my new code.

### PROJECTS
This page displays my featured projects. I recorded and created a Gif of a quick demo of each application. I created each of the logos of the apps with Adobe XD. I also include clickable links to the Github repos and the working application.

### RESUME
My resume displays an image of my resume that I also created on Adobe XD. Users have the ability to print and download my resume.

### CONTACT
The contact page contains clickable links to my Github, LinkedIn, and Email. There is also a contact form if users would to send me a quick message. Netlify handles the POST for the form input and notifies me via email so I can respond promptly.

#### FUTURE IDEAS
- [ ] Change from multi-page to single-page
- [ ] Add animations to logo and nav links
